A single page, one-column resume for experienced Full Stack Developers created in Latex. It uses base latex template and fonts to provide ease of use when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The template created is insipired from [sb2nov](http://github.com/sb2nov).

### Motivation
I had to update my resume for applying to jobs. After watching a lot of youtube videos and exploring, I concluded some points, 
1. Resume should be single page and one-column. 
2. Lots of developers were using Latex instead of Word Processors. 
Most currently available templates either focus on two columns, or are multiple pages long that didn't work well for career fairs or online applications. Inspired from a template by [sb2nov](http://github.com/sb2nov), I created this resume in Latex.

I edited the template in Overleaf. You can find the overleaf template here [FSD_Resume.tex](https://www.overleaf.com/read/mvxtzqfdmqtx)
