A single page one column resume for experienced Full Stack Developers in Latex. It uses base latex template and fonts to provide ease of use when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The template created is insipired from sb2nov.

#Motivation
I had to update my resume for applying to jobs. After watching a lot of youtube videos and exploring, I concluded two points, 1. the resume should be single page and one-column. 2. Lots of developers were using Latex instead of Word Processors. Inspired from a template in overleaf, created this resume in Latex.
